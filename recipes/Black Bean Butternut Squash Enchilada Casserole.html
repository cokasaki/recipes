    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

<li>4-5 cups butternut squash, cubed</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>Vegetable mixture:</li>
<li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>1 green bell pepper, chopped into cubes</li>
<li>1 red bell pepper , chopped into cubes</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin, or more</li>

<li>1 can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon and 1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>Ingredient for assembling the casserole:</li>
<li>1 cup salsa (to go on the bottom of the casserole dish)</li>
<li>12 corn tortillas, 6 inch diameter (4 corn tortillas per each of 3 layers)</li>
<li>1 and 1/2 cups sour cream (1/2 cup sour cream for each of 3 layers)</li>
<li>1 cup enchilada sauce (if you're gluten free, make sure to buy the sauce without gluten!)</li>
<li>1 and 1/2 and 1/4 cups Mozzarella cheese (1/2 cup mozzarella cheese for each layer plus extra on top)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Roasted butternut squash:</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 375 F. Line the baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
<li>Peel the squash and slice it into 3/4 inch cubes. You will only need about 1/2 of the medium size squash. Toss the squash cubes in a large bowl with 2 tablespoons olive oil and generously sprinkle with salt.</li>
<li>Put butternut squash on the greased baking sheet and roast for about 30 minutes, until soft. Flip the squash cubes over midway through baking. Let it cool slightly.</li>
<li>Roasting vegetables on the stove top:</li>
<li>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat. Add chopped onion, chopped green bell pepper, and chopped red bell pepper, 1 teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon chili powder, and roast the vegetables in olive oil and spices on high heat until charred just a bit. Mid-way through, add corn, then rinsed and drained black beans. Add roasted butternut squash. Season with 1/4 teaspoon + 1/8 teaspoon salt and taste. Add more salt if needed. Add more chili powder or cumin, than indicated in the recipe, if needed.</li>
<li>Assembling the casserole:</li>
<li>I used a casserole dish 11 inches long x 8.5 inches wide x 3 inches deep. Add 1 cup of salsa to the bottom of this 3 inch deep casserole dish and spread to coat the bottom evenly. Top with 4 tortillas, overlapping to cover the bottom of the casserole dish.</li>
<li>Spread 1/3 of the vegetable mixture over the tortillas. Top with 1/2 cup sour cream, dropping it in small dollops all over, then carefully spreading it over the veggies. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup Mozzarella cheese. Top with 4 tortillas.</li>
<li>Spread 1/3 of the vegetable mixture over the tortillas. Top with 1/2 cup sour cream, dropping it in small dollops all over, then spreading it carefully over the veggies. Pour 1/2 cup enchilada sauce evenly all over, at the same time spreading sour cream evenly all over. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup Mozzarella cheese. Top with 4 tortillas.</li>

<li>Bake at 375 F for 25 minutes covered, then remove foil, and bake for 10 more minutes uncovered.</li>
