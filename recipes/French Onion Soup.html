    <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Top</a></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>½ C. unsalted butter</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
<li>2 bay leaves</li>
<li>2 fresh thyme sprigs</li>
<li>4-5 large onions, sliced (we used red last time, want to try sweet yellow next time)</li>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 cup red wine, about 1/2 bottle</li>
<li>3 heaping tablespoons all-purpose (gluten-free) flour</li>
<li>2 quarts beef (vegetable) broth</li>
<li>1 baguette, sliced</li>
<li>1/2 pound grated Gruyere</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Melt the stick of butter in a soup pan over medium heat.</li>
<li>Add the garlic, bay leaves, thyme, onions, salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Cook until the onions are very soft and caramelized, about an hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
<li>Add the wine, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the wine has evaporated and the onions are mostly dry, about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Discard the bay leaves and the thyme sprigs.</li>
<li>Dust the onions with the flour and give them a stir.</li>
<li>Turn the heat down to meidum low so that the flour doesn’t burn. Cook for 10 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste.</li>
<li>Add the beef broth, bring the soup to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Season, to taste, with additional salt and pepper.</li>
<li>When you are ready to serve, preheat the boiler.</li>
<li>Arrange the baguette slices with the Gruyere and broil until bubbly and golden brown, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
<li>Ladle the soup in bowls and float several of the Gruyere croutons on top.</li>
    </ol>
