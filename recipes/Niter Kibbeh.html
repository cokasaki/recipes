    <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Top</a></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>1 pound butter</li>
<li>4 to 5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 small yellow onion, chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon grated ginger</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
<li>Optional additional spices:</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cardamom seeds</li>
<li>1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds or kalonji/nigella seeds</li>
<li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
<li>1 clove</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Place all ingredients in a saucepan over medium-low heat. As foam rises to the top, skim it off with a spoon. If it rises too much like it is going to boil over, lower the heat.</li>
<li>Continue simmering gently until there is no more foam, about 30 minutes. It is done when the butter is clear on top and the solids sink to the bottom. Remove from heat.</li>
<li>Place a strainer over a heat-proof bowl and line it with cheesecloth or a coffee filter. Pour the butter through the strainer and discard the solids. Strain as many times as necessary to achieve a completely clear butter with no residue or spices.</li>
    </ol>
