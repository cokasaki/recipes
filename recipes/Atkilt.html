    <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Top</a></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
<li>4 carrots, sliced (I think the carrots really carry the dish. They add some nice sweetness. I double or triple the carrots)</li>
<li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
<li>1 small head cabbage, sliced</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>4 small yellow potatoes, cut into bite-size cubes</li>
<li>1/4 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute carrots in hot oil until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add onion; saute until onion is fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Season carrot mixture with turmeric, cumin, pepper, and ground ginger; stir and let the seasonings toast until fragrant, about 1 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir cabbage and garlic into the carrot mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage wilts, about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir potatoes into the cabbage mixture. Pour water into the pot and stir. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer, stirring every 10 minutes, until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
