    <h1>Macaroni and Cheese</h1>
    <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Top</a></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>1 (1 pound) box (gluten-free) elbow macaroni (or other pasta)</li>
<li>1 pound extra sharp cheddar cheese (grated)</li>
<li>1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Heat water to boiling in a big pot.</li>
<li>Add pasta to boiling water.  Stir to get the clumps broken up.  Cook for about 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.   (This time is for elbow mac -- other pasta shapes may take longer.)</li>
<li>While pasta is cooking:<ul><li>Grate cheese (if necessary).</li><li>Beat eggs in a bowl.  Add about 2/3rds of the evaporated milk and mix.</li></ul></li>
<li>Take out one piece of pasta.  Blow on it to cool, and tilt&shake it to get out any water trapped inside.  Taste it to make sure pasta is done.</li>
<li>When pasta is done, drain in a colander, then put pasta back in pot.</li>
<li>Add grated cheese to pasta and stir to mix.</li>
<li>Over low heat, add the egg-milk mixture to the pasta and cheese.  Stir quickly so that eggs don't scramble.</li>
<li>Continue to cook, stirring frequently, for a few minutes until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy.  During this time, if the sauce seems too thick, stir in some of the remaining milk.</li>
    </ol>
