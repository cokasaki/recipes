    <h1>BBQ Jackfruit</h1>
    <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Top</a></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>2 20-ounce cans young green jackfruit in water (NOT in syrup or brine*)</li>
<li>1/4 cup BBQ seasoning (For 1/4 cup or ~45 g BBQ seasoning, use 2 Tbsp brown sugar + 1 tsp paprika + 1 tsp garlic powder + 1/2 tsp salt + 1/2 tsp pepper + 1/2 tsp chili powder)</li>
<li>3/4 cup BBQ sauce (plus more for topping)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Rinse, drain, and thoroughly dry jackfruit. Chop off the center “core” portion of the fruit and discard. Place in a mixing bowl and set aside.</li>
<li>Mix together BBQ seasoning and add to jackfruit. Toss to coat.</li>
<li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1-2 Tbsp oil of choice and seasoned jackfruit (use more oil, as needed, if increasing batch size). Toss to coat and cook for 2-3 minutes to achieve some color.</li>
<li>Add BBQ sauce and thin with enough water to make a sauce. Stir and reduce heat to low- medium and cook for about 20 minutes (up to 35 minutes on low for a deeper flavor).</li>
<li>Remove lid and stir occasionally. TIP: For finer texture, use two forks to shred the jackfruit as it cooks down.</li>
<li>Once the jackfruit has been properly simmered, turn up heat to medium-high and cook for 2-3 more minutes to get a little extra color/texture. Then remove from heat.</li>
<li>Leftover jackfruit keeps for up to a couple days in the fridge, though best when fresh.</li>
    </ol>
