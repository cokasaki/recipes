1 package fresh spinach (10 oz)
3 spoons soy sauce
2 spoons sesame oil
1 spoon roasted sesame seeds
1 spoon sugar

Blanch the spinach for 30 seconds in boiling water. The spinach should turn bright green.
Immediately run under cold water. I do this in about 3-4 batches for the bag of spinach. I use my straining spoon to get the spinach out of the water and into the strainer.
Squeeze out the excess water -- grab a handful and squeeze it into a ball.
Cut each ball into smaller pieces, about every ½”.
Mix the dressing in a bowl. Note that I use one of the large silverware spoons. 
Loosen the pieces of spinach and add to the dressing.
Mix.
Chill.
