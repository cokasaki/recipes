4 or 5 1/4-inch crosswise slices bacon (we use frozen, but thawed should be fine)
4 cups cooked rice, refrigerated for at least a day, preferably 2 days or more
3 tablespoons tamari
1 cup frozen peas (preferably "petite peas")
5 eggs

Cook the bacon over medium heat until most of the grease is released and the pieces are a little bit crispy.
Turn down the heat and add the rice.  Stir together with the bacon. 
Turn the heat back to medium.  Sprinkle the soy sauce over the rice and stir together.  Cook for a minute or two.
Stir in the peas and cook for another minute.
Push everything in the pan over to one side, and add the eggs in the open side.  Shift the pan on the burner so that it is mostly the eggs that are over the heat.
Scramble the eggs until they are mostly cooked, then stir the eggs together with all the rice.
Cook for a few more minutes.
Serve.
