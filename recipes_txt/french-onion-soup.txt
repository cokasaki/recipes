½ C. unsalted butter
2 garlic cloves, chopped
2 bay leaves
2 fresh thyme sprigs
4-5 large onions, sliced (we used red last time, want to try sweet yellow next time)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 cup red wine, about 1/2 bottle
3 heaping tablespoons all-purpose (gluten-free) flour
2 quarts beef (vegetable) broth
1 baguette, sliced
1/2 pound grated Gruyere

Melt the stick of butter in a soup pan over medium heat.
Add the garlic, bay leaves, thyme, onions, salt and pepper.
Cook until the onions are very soft and caramelized, about an hour, stirring occasionally.
Add the wine, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the wine has evaporated and the onions are mostly dry, about 15 minutes.
Discard the bay leaves and the thyme sprigs.
Dust the onions with the flour and give them a stir.
Turn the heat down to meidum low so that the flour doesn’t burn. Cook for 10 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste.
Add the beef broth, bring the soup to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes.
Season, to taste, with additional salt and pepper.
When you are ready to serve, preheat the boiler.
Arrange the baguette slices with the Gruyere and broil until bubbly and golden brown, about 3-5 minutes.
Ladle the soup in bowls and float several of the Gruyere croutons on top.
