1 T. tamari
Seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic, etc) to taste

Remove tip of wing and separate at joint. Discard tip. (Chicken wings now come already separated and frozen in 5 lb. bags)
Season wings with salt, pepper, garlic, etc.
Coat wings with cornstarch, dip into egg and brown in a little bit of oil.
Lay flat in a single layer in a baking pan. Do NOT stack the wings.
Mix sugar, vinegar, water, pineapple chunks, ketchup, tamari.
You may add vegetables such as bell pepper, onion, carrots or anything else you wish or leave the wings plain.
Pour sauce over wings and bake at 350-375 for 45 minutes.
Baste several times.
