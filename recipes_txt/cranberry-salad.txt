1 bag fresh cranberries
1 medium (17 oz maybe?) can crushed pineapple
sugar
red seedless grapes
chopped walnuts (optional)

Coarsely chop the cranberries. (A food processor works well for this.)
Thoroughly drain the pineapple.
Quarter the grapes.  (1/2 a pound, or more if you like grapes).
Mix fruit with 1/4 to 1/2 cup sugar.
Add chopped walnuts if desired.  (1/2 a cup to 1 cup, or even more if you like walnuts)
Let sit overnight.
10-60 minutes before serving:
Whip the cream.  (1 small carton, or a little more.  If desired, whip 1 or 2 teaspoons of powdered sugar in with the cream.)
Fold the whipped cream into the fruit.
