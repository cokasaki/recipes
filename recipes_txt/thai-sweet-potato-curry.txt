1 tablespoon oil
2 shallots, thinly sliced
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
3-4 cups fresh baby spinach
2-3 tablespoons curry paste (red or yellow, recommended homemade: recipe)
1 14-ounce can regular coconut milk
1/2 to 1 cup broth or water (recommend broth)
1/2 cup chopped peanuts and cilantro
fish sauce to taste (really good even without this!)    
Soy sauce to taste (not in the original recipe but really rounds it out)                 
Start your rice, if youâ€™re serving this over rice (highly recommend)!
Heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the shallots and stir fry until soft and fragrant. Add the sweet potatoes and stir to coat with oil. Add the curry paste and stir until well-combined.
Add the coconut milk and broth and let it simmer over low heat for 10-15 minutes until thickened. Stir in the spinach until wilted.
Add half of the peanut/cilantro mixture; reserve the rest for topping. Add a quick splash of fish sauce to the curry to make the whole thing just sing harmony in your mouth. Yummy.
Serve over rice, topped with remaining peanuts/cilantro.
