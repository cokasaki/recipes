4 tablespoons niter kibbeh, divided (recipe)
1 large yellow onion, very finely diced
3 cloves garlic, finely minced
1 Roma tomato, very finely chopped
3 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons berbere, divided (recipe)
1 cup red lentils, rinsed
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth 
1 teaspoon salt

Melt 3 tablespoons of the niter kibbeh in a medium stock pot.  Add the onions and cook over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes until golden brown.  
Add the garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste and 1 tablespoon of the berbere and cook for 5-7 minutes. Reduce the heat if needed to prevent burning.
Add the broth and salt, bring it to a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover and simmer the lentils, stirring occasionally, for 40 minutes (adding more broth if needed) or until the lentils are soft.
Stir in the remaining tablespoon of niter kibbeh and berbere. Simmer for a couple more minutes. Add salt to taste.
Serve with injera
