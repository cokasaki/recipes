4-6 carrots, shredded
~1 cup raisins
1-2 granny smith apples, cored and shredded (peeling optional)
1 small can crushed pineapple (optional), well drained
¼ - ½ cup mayonnaise (or plain yogurt or Greek yogurt)

Shred the carrots using a grater (medium-sized holes if it has different sizes) or a food processor.
Mix everything except the apples.
Start with about ¼ cup mayonnaise or yogurt, and add more until it’s about as creamy as you want it to be.
Grate and immediately stir in the apples (to keep them from getting brown).
Stir in more mayonnaise or yogurt if desired.
Can be eaten immediately, but it’s probably better if you let it sit in the refrigerator for 15 minutes-2 hours before serving.
