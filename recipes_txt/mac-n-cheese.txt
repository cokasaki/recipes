1 (1 pound) box (gluten-free) elbow macaroni (or other pasta)
1 pound extra sharp cheddar cheese (grated)
1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk
2 eggs

Heat water to boiling in a big pot.
Add pasta to boiling water.  Stir to get the clumps broken up.  Cook for about 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.   (This time is for elbow mac -- other pasta shapes may take longer.)
While pasta is cooking:<ul><li>Grate cheese (if necessary).</li><li>Beat eggs in a bowl.  Add about 2/3rds of the evaporated milk and mix.</li></ul>
Take out one piece of pasta.  Blow on it to cool, and tilt&shake it to get out any water trapped inside.  Taste it to make sure pasta is done.
When pasta is done, drain in a colander, then put pasta back in pot.
Add grated cheese to pasta and stir to mix.
Over low heat, add the egg-milk mixture to the pasta and cheese.  Stir quickly so that eggs don't scramble.  
Continue to cook, stirring frequently, for a few minutes until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy.  During this time, if the sauce seems too thick, stir in some of the remaining milk.
